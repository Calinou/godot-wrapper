Godot-wrapper
=============

A BASH script that downloads and integrates the [Godot engine](http://www.godotengine.org/) for Ubuntu. The application icon belongs to the [Godot project](https://github.com/okamstudio/godot)

There's a one-liner copy-and-paste here below to get Godot installed:

```Shell
cd /opt && git clone https://github.com/nsrosenqvist/godot-wrapper.git godot && cd godot && sudo godot install
```

Now you should be able to launch Godot from the application menu and update to new releases by running `godot update`.
